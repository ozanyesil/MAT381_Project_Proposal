    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we will use two datasets.  \n",
    "Our first dataset is taken from Kaggle:\n",
    "[Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/secareanualin/football-events?select=events.csv) \n",
    "\n",
    "It contains an explanatory text file and a csv file which we will be using to analyze.  \n",
    "This dataset is basically an event data. It contains 9,074 football matches and more than 900,000 events that occured in the top 5 European football leagues (England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France) between the beginning of 2011/2012 season and 25.01.2017 which is longer than 5 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gives the information about matches, events that happened in the match (events are represented by numbers and the meaning of numbers are explained in the text file) and depending on the event there are more detailed data about that event. For example, if the event is shooting then, in the other columns there are informations about location of the shot, the outcome of the shot \n",
    "(goal or not), the player who did it etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our second dataset is again taken from Kaggle: [Dataset 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset)  \n",
    "This dataset is player data that contains lots of information about players for the video game series FIFA. It includes data between 2015 and 2020. We will use this dataset in order to learn preferred foot of players and then include it in xG calculations.\n",

    "## Description of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "With tha data we have we want to dive deeper about expected goal statistic that is not very well-known and understood by fans. Our main purpose will be to calculate expected goal according to data we have. Also, we want to support our calculations with visualizations that we extract from our data such as shot distance maps, advantage of playing at home, distributions of goals by minutes. Red and yellow card statistics depending on  the league.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the project we will be answered these questions:\n",
    "* Is playing at home is really advantageous?\n",
    "* What is expected goal (xG)?\n",
    "* Does it help teams to win matches if they have more xG than opponent? \n",
    "* Is the xG value a criterion for success? (Comparing teams' league standings and their xG average)\n",
    "* Which league has the highest xG per match among these 5 leagues?\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, datasets are interesting because they are very detailed and it records events in a football match. It shows the improvement in data tracking in sports industry. Also, it is good for finding answers to questions ,that comes our minds as footbal fans, supported by real data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "**Literature Review:** In order to understand the expected goal calculation and the logic behind it.  \n",
    "**Data Cleaning:** Gathering data and splitting it to do visualizations easier. For example, grouping leagues and evaluating them seperately, changing column names to work more comfortable. Also, we will check if there are missing values.  \n",
    "**Visualization:** Visualizing shot maps, goal distribution by minutes.  \n",
    "**Calculation:** After understanding xG betterand cleaning our data we will do calculations.  \n",
    "**Analysis:** After all visualizations and calculations, we will evaluate our models and graphics to answer our questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware and Software\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python programming language and its libraries and Jupyter Notebook environment. We will be doing this project on our laptops with 8 GB RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calendar\n",
    "\n",
    "* Literature review: 1 week\n",
    "* Cleaning the data: 1 week \n",
    "* Visualization: 10-14 days\n",
    "* Modelling: 2 weeks\n",
    "* Final Analysis: 10 days\n",
    "\n",
    "**Literature review will not be done seperately, it will be synchronized with other steps.**"
